# Sparta_Global_SDET_Capybara_Eccomerce_Lab

This is a page object model based on a E-commerce website (http://automationpractice.com/index.php) tested using capybara. It tests that a user can successfully sign into there account and then go on to successfully buy a product. It works by running rpsec in the console log of the root file of this project.

This project has been conducted using capybara, which is specific to the Ruby library and is used as an underlying web-based driver and an extension to selenium.
